                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs for 2022</h2>
                <p>Online courses are available for students and learners to pursue from anywhere across the world and
                    various learning platforms also provide students with courses to pursue free of cost. Free online
                    courses are a very good option available at the disposal of all students to enhance their knowledge
                    and
                    skills. Here we have broken down the basics and details of online learning courses along with some
                    of
                    the top curated free online learning courses with certificates in India. </p><br>
                <p>An online course is an educational course that allows students to get access to learning materials
                    from
                    any remote location through the use of an electronic device and an internet connection. An online
                    course
                    can be offered either by an online learning platform or independently by an online university as
                    well.
                    Many educational institutions and experienced academicians and professionals are now offering
                    courses in
                    their area of specialization in the online format. </p><br>
                <p>Many students are turning to online educational means, especially in the times of the recent
                    worldwide
                    pandemic when online courses ensured that education was unhampered and not disrupted. But many
                    students and working professionals are still wary of investing their time and resources in an
                    online course as they are confused about the actual value of an online degree. While it is
                    impossible to completely replicate the face-to-face offline learning environment, online
                    courses with newer technologies have bridged the gap to a large extent. Online courses are of equal
                    value if not more, provided they have been obtained from a credible source. Moreover, for
                    professional ventures, short-term courses or certification courses, online courses are
                    valued if they contribute meaningfully to the skill development of the person.
                    So, we can say that yes, online courses also have great value today in the domain of education and
                    skill development for students as well as professionals. </p><br>
                <p>According to the latest national educational guidelines by bodies such as UGC, no professional or
                    academic organization can discriminate against an online course completed by a student provided it
                    has been obtained from an accredited and authorized educational institution.

                    So, if you have completed an online course from a reputed and credible organization or online
                    learning platform, then your course certificate/ diploma/ degree will definitely add good value to
                    your professional profile and credibility. It may also be helpful for you to explore a new career
                    domain or move up the professional ladder in your already established career.

                    Even in the case of an online course that you completed without certification if the course has
                    contributed significantly to your skill set or knowledge, it surely makes you better groomed and
                    well-equipped for any professional venture.

                    So, online courses also have considerable job value as they are equally valid as an offline course
                    (provided the source of education is valid and credible). A student can benefit much from the
                    knowledge gained through online courses available across a large number of platforms today. </p>
